# POM - Plugins (plugin base)

The public starter and tutorial for building plugins for the POM. It shows the host ABI boundary, automatic menu registration with submenus through `pom-plugin-ui/v1`, embedded React screens in the pieceofmind.cloud visual identity, locale catalogs, the `pom-plugin-events/v1` events and notifications protocol, and repeatable build and packaging commands.

The plugin appears in the POM sidebar as **POM - Plugins**, with the POM icon and two submenus:

- **Plugin**: the tutorial. How to build a plugin in five steps, every feature a plugin can use, and a live demo that sends a notice to this user, a notice to the whole network, and an Accept or Cancel question whose answer comes back to the screen. It also shows the events received by the screen (language, theme) and by the native backend (`host.event`).
- **Projects**: the shared workspace project list, a small screen to copy when starting a new view.

## Project layout

```text
Cargo.toml             Rust cdylib and dependencies
src/lib.rs              Versioned plugin ABI and UI asset interface
build.rs                Embeds built UI files and locale catalogs
ui/manifest.json        Menu, submenu, route, screen, locale, description, screenshot, and asset declarations
ui/src/host/runtime.ts   Host SDK helpers: i18n, plugin API, events and notifications
ui/src/screens/          React screen components (Tutorial, Projects)
ui/src/plugin.css        Screen styles (pieceofmind.cloud identity, light and dark)
ui/icon.png              Plugin-owned menu image (the POM icon)
docs/                    Guides shown in plugin documentation
docs/screenshots/        Screenshots listed in the manifest, loaded by the POM from GitHub
i18n/                    en and pt-BR catalogs
scripts/                 UI, native build, and package commands
```

The UI manifest sets `plugin_code` to `base`, registers `ui/icon.png` as the plugin-owned menu image, declares a localized `description` and the `screenshots` shown on the POM Plugins screen, and lists the Markdown files under `docs/` for the POM documentation view. The single menu item has `children`, so the POM draws a sidebar section with the **Plugin** and **Projects** submenus; the parent keeps `to` so hosts without submenu support still show one entry. Screenshots are paths relative to the repository root: the POM turns them into `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs, so they are never embedded or sent through the license server. The exported C entry point is `pom_base_plugin_v1`. Release metadata lives separately in `release/manifest.json`: it declares the namespaced `base.core` capability and example local preferences, one boolean feature toggle and one storage directory. The UI manifest remains the `pom-plugin-ui/v1` contract and does not carry license or release preferences.

Locale source keys stay plugin-neutral; the UI build prefixes them with the current `plugin_code` for the POM translation catalog. The same build scopes CSS class names and matching screen markup to that code. When cloning the scaffold, change `plugin_code` in `ui/manifest.json` and the generated identifiers follow it.

## Build and verify

Requirements: Rust stable, Node.js 20 or newer, and npm.

```sh
cargo test
cargo fmt --check
scripts/build-ui.sh
```

Build the native library and copy a named artifact with its SHA-256 and size:

```sh
scripts/build.sh --platform macos-aarch64
```

Supported platform identifiers are `linux-x86_64`, `macos-aarch64`, and `windows-x86_64`. Package the library with small build metadata:

```sh
scripts/package.sh --platform macos-aarch64 --version 0.1.0
```

Both build commands accept `--output <dir>`. By default, artifacts go to `dist-release/`, which is ignored by Git.

## GitHub release workflow

POM - Plugins is a public plugin: it is installed from its GitHub releases (POM, Plugins, Add from GitHub) and never goes through the license server.

The manual `Publish plugin release` workflow builds the selected platforms and attaches the packages to a GitHub release; `prerelease` only marks the GitHub release. Each selected platform can use its own `vX.Y.Z` tag; choose the same tag when publishing assets for one multi-platform release. Each platform package also generates `pom-plugin-<os>-<arch>.json`, the public GitHub update manifest consumed by POM, with the typed `preferences` schema, the `feature_set` and the SHA-256 and byte size of the adjacent native asset; keep both assets attached to the release. The preference values themselves are always stored by POM locally. No repository secret is needed.

The workflow and its plan helper are in `.github/workflows/publish-release.yml` and `scripts/`.

## Shared workspace contract

The POM owns the user's shared project folder and passes it to an active plugin
through the optional top-level `workspace_root` field of `host.configure`:

```json
{
  "operation": "host.configure",
  "workspace_root": "/path/to/projects"
}
```

This base plugin does not ask the user to choose a folder and does not derive a
fallback root. It keeps the received value in memory, exposes a loopback
`ui.upstream` endpoint to the POM, and serves `GET /projects` through the
authenticated plugin proxy. The endpoint reads only immediate child
directories, sorts their names, and omits hidden entries such as `.plugin-state`
so plugin state cannot appear as a user project.

The Projects screen renders `ready`, `empty`, and `unavailable` responses. A
missing or inaccessible root is unavailable, and a readable root without
projects is empty; neither condition prevents the plugin from loading.

## Events and notifications

The POM and the plugin exchange `pom-plugin-events/v1` envelopes (`protocol`, `id`, `type`, `target`, `source`, `at`, `payload`). The POM sends `locale.changed`, `theme.changed`, `preferences.changed`, `deployment.started`, `model.serving`, `model.stopped`, `notification.received` and `notification.response` through the host SDK (`__POM_HOST__.plugin(code).events`), the `pom:plugin-event` DOM event, same-origin iframes marked with `data-pom-plugin`, and the native `host.event` query operation. The plugin sends `notification.notify` (to this user or, with `scope: "network"`, to every node) and `notification.confirm` (Accept or Reject in the POM notification bell, or `display: "dialog"` for a modal), and receives the answer as `notification.response`. `ui/src/host/runtime.ts` wraps it all in `usePomEvent`, `usePomContext`, `notify` and `confirm`. See [docs/guia-eventos.md](docs/guia-eventos.md).

## Start a plugin

1. Update the package name, plugin code, and exported entry point for the new plugin.
2. Add or adjust its menu items and submenus, routes, screen exports, icon image, description, screenshots, and documentation paths in `ui/manifest.json`.
3. Implement plugin behavior behind the versioned ABI in `src/lib.rs`.
4. Add screen components under `ui/src/screens/`, guides under `docs/`, and keep the `en` and `pt-BR` catalogs aligned.
5. Run the verification and build commands above before packaging.

The UI bundle is generated under `ui/dist/`; the bundle, PNG icon, and Markdown guides are embedded into the native library during the Rust build. Do not commit the generated directory.
